# Brain Tumor Image Analysis Project

This project, conducted at Seneca Polytechnic, focuses on the segmentation of brain tumors in multimodal MRI scans using the BraTS 2020 dataset. The goal is to accurately segment three tumor sub-regions: GD-enhancing tumor (ET), peritumoral edema (ED), and necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core (NCR/NET). By developing an automated segmentation method using deep learning techniques, we aim to assist medical professionals in more efficiently and accurately analyzing brain tumor MRI scans for improved diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring.
